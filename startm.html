<p><b>Message from the editor</b> Welcome to the latest version of Wish's home page. The last time we saw each other was in a material design page, which offered a sleek way to surf the web. The focus of it was put on fun, media and highly interactive content; in other words, the page was meant to do. Time has passed and the philosophy of the editing team is no longer the same. Our principles have been redefined and so must be this page's layout, in order to keep a coherence in all of the team's work. Now, the content and development of ideas is fundamental, so this new page is inspired by the most objective and familiar text: the newspaper. The objective of this site, is to give you a canvas to be filled with the best ideas. I hope you have fun in your quest for whatever makes you a better person. Be careful and update this page whenever you can. Remember that this is all for you. Greetings, <i>Wish Duenas</i></p>

<p class="subtitle">I have a dream</p><p>These are extracts from the speech delivered by Martin Luther King Jr on 28 August 1963.<br><br>Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred. We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence. [...]<br>We cannot walk alone.<br>And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead.<br>We cannot turn back. [...]<br>And so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream.<br>I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.

<p class="subtitle">The hero complex</p><p>I've been reading the Night Angel trilogy.  It's okay. [...]<br>The main character is introduced on page 1.  He is normal.  But we discover that he is indeed NOT NORMAL.  He is marked for greatness.  He is special.<br>You see this everywhere. [...]<br>n better cases, he is defined by a single act.  He slays a dragon, pulls a sword from a stone.  His victory is an event, a crowning moment.<br>In worse cases, she is special in spite of her inadequacies. [...]<br>None of this is real life.  In real life, you don't get chosen at random for greatness.  No one is truly exceptional because of their father.  No one harbors any latent magic ability to control the Force.  We are all just regular people.  We will not be thrust into greatness.<br>Neither are we defined by a single act.  No one pulls swords from stones or defeats an emperor and then is DONE. Yet in fiction, the main character does one great thing, pretty much out of nowhere, and that defines them.[...]<br>Fiction would have us believe that all we have to do is sit on our butts and wait for the narrator to write us something extraordinary. It ain't happening.<br>You want to live extraordinarily?  You're going to have to do something about it.  Something absolutely ordinary.  Like practice your guitar scales.  Push yourself to speak to three groups of strangers.  Write 750 words.  Every day.  For years and years.  And then, maybe, at the end of that un-filmable and un-narratable journey, you'll be an overnight success.</p>
